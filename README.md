## Getting Started

### Desktop Version (Electron)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Build for distribution:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Web Version

The application also includes a web version that can be accessed directly in your browser:

1. Navigate to the `web/` directory
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Your progress is automatically saved locally using browser storage

## Data Format

The application now supports multiple valid translations with contextual descriptions:

```json
{
    "kanji": "åƒ•",
    "furigana": "boku", 
    "translations": [
        {
            "text": "I",
            "description": "male"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Translation Validation**: Only the main `text` is used for answer validation. Descriptions in parentheses provide context but are not required for correct answers.

**Display Format**: Descriptions are shown as `I (male)` but answering just "I" is sufficient for a correct response.

## Project Structure

### Desktop App (Electron)
- `src/main.js` - Electron main process
- `src/preload.js` - Preload script for secure IPC
- `src/index.html` - Main application UI
- `src/styles.css` - Application styling
- `src/app.js` - Frontend JavaScript logic

### Web App
- `web/index.html` - Web version UI
- `web/styles.css` - Web-specific styling

## Data Migration

This application is ported from the original Python version and maintains compatibility with existing user data. Your `user_data.json` and `words.json` files will work seamlessly with the new Electron interface.

## Development

The application uses modern web technologies within Electron:
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks for simplicity)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for secure data handling (desktop version)
- File-based JSON storage for desktop, localStorage for web
- Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for randomized reviews
- Real-time next review calculations

## Recent Improvements

- **Randomized Review Cards**: Each review session now shuffles cards to prevent memorization patterns
- **Next Review Timer**: Dashboard displays exactly when your next review batch will be available
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved visual feedback and animations
- **Dual Platform**: Both desktop (Electron) and web versions available
